This is my solution to Wally's Widgets challenge

I decided to host it in laravel and the bulk of the logic sits in widgetController in the function order

I ran out of time to tidy it up slightly and decided the logic was more important
Given additional time I would make a number of improvements

1) store the widget pack sizes in a db and allow them to be changed etc
2) add css to the pages to make them look nicer
3) add more error handling to the pages, for example cover for empty inputs etc
